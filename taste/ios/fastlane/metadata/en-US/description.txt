Discover food with friends!
 
Taste shows you all of your friends' dining recommendations and experiences, and lets you share yours as well! Why look at generic reviews online when you can get recommendations you trust from the people that matter to you.
 
Taste is all about sharing! When you go out to eat, just snap a quick pic, give it a simple rating (like, dislike, love), and post! Your friends will be able to see where you've eaten and how you like it, and you can keep track of all the places you love to eat!
 
On the other hand, when you're looking for a place to eat, simply open the Taste Map and see all the nearby spots your friends love!
 
Here's what you can do with Taste!
 
• Explore: Discover new restaurants on the Taste Map, recommended by people you trust!
 
• Food Feed: See the latest posts from friends in the Taste Feed! Scroll to see what your friends are up to and their favorite spots.
 
• Share: Rate your dining experiences and share them with your friends to help them find the restaurants you've enjoyed! (Or stay clear of the ones you haven't)
 
• Profile: Keep track of the places you love to eat in your profile. You'll never have to ask "What was that one place I ate?" ever again! Even better, you can view all of your posts on the Profile Map, to see a timeline of where you've been!
 
• Bookmarks: Whenever you see a delicious meal you want to save for later, just bookmark it! Keep track of the restaurants you want to visit in the bookmarks tab of your profile.
